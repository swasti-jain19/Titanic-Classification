## About the Project 💻

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is a well-known historical tragedy. This project leverages machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived based on features like age, sex, class, and family relations. It's a classic introductory project for anyone diving into data science and predictive modeling.

Key aspects of this project:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Feature engineering to improve model performance.
- Training and evaluating various machine learning models.

## Project Workflow 📚

1.  **Data Collection and Overview:**
    -   Gathering the Titanic dataset and understanding its structure.

2.  **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:**
    -   Handling missing values, outliers, and converting categorical data.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    -   Visualizing data, identifying patterns, and understanding feature relationships.

4.  **Feature Engineering:**
    -   Creating new features (e.g., family size, title extraction) to enhance model accuracy.

5.  **Model Selection and Training:**
    -   Splitting data into training and testing sets.
    -   Training models like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

6.  **Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics:**
    -   Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    -   Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

7.  **Conclusion and Results:**
    -   Summarizing model performance and identifying important features.
